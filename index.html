        Hi, my name is Mia. Based on the many different lives I've lived in my 30 years, you may know me as a student, anthropologist, financial aid advisor, teacher, advocate, community manager, writer, or entrepreneur... While these may seem like a random list of careers, there are a few things they have in common and those are the things that make me tick:
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong> PEOPLE and PUZZLES. </strong>
      </p>
      <p>
        As an introvert who loves people, I've long been fascinated by how similar, yet unique, humans can be. Many hours of my childhood were spent quietly people-watching. Whether it was my large family gathered around my grandma's table, or strangers at the coffee shop, I would sit enthralled watching the scenes play out and trying to predict what would happen next. While I got really good at guessing how people would react to different situations, I also started making up stories to explain the <em> why </em> of what they were doing. To me, this was the puzzle. And puzzles were my other love.
      </p>
      <p>
        While people presented puzzles that often could never be fully solved, math and science presented challenges that could usually be solved simply by turning things around in my head. This balanced out my need for answers and at least partially satisfied my constant curiousity.
      </p>
      <p>
        Although the many hats I've worn over the years have helped me better understand people and how to solve problems, they involved limits that never fully allowed me to make the changes I felt needed made to fix the real issue. Now, after accidentally discovering entrepreneurship and the freedom it offered, I'm seeing if this is the path that will help me satisfy my need for a balance between flexibility and structure; people and solitude; challenges and solutions.
      </p>
      <p>
        When not working, I can usually be found at home, cuddled up with my cat and dog, drinking a cup of coffee and reading a sci-fi or mystery novel. I also enjoy traveling the world with my husband and friends.
